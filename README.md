In this AngularJS Exercise I aim to achieve the following:

1.Write a single-page application using AngularJS that displays a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

2.Provide users with a way to randomly shuffle the deck.

3.Provide users with the means to sort the deck in ascending order. I am defining ascending order as Ace>King, with the bycicle playing cards suit order of Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts.


In order to run tests:

    npm install 
    
    karma start


Some inspiration behind a good shuffle, [John Bonomo](https://open.kattis.com/contests/ecna15practice/problems/shuffling).

Thanks to [Cburnett on the Wikipedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cburnett/GFDL_images/Playing_cards) for the card deck, which is liscened with GFDL permission.
