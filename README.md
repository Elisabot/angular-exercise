In this AngularJS Exercise I aim to achieve the following:

1.Write a single-page application (SPA) using AngularJS that displays a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

2. Provide users with a way to randomly shuffle the deck.

3. Provide users with the means to sort the deck in ascending order.



Logic behind a good shuffle thanks to [John Bonomo](https://open.kattis.com/contests/ecna15practice/problems/shuffling)

Thanks to [Cburnett on Wikipedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cburnett/GFDL_images/Playing_cards) for the card deck, which are liscened with GFDL permission.
